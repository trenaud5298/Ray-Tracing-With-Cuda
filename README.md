This is a simple Ray Tracing Engine Developed With Cuda for a personal project.
Code is not super neat due to this only being a revision and not the final product.
This Ray Tracing Engine has the ability to render diffuse and specular reflections/lighting
and has support for triangles and spheres. Materials can be rough or smooth and also 
supports a simple implemnentation of HDR. Transparency has not yet been implemented
and should be added in a later revision of the project.
